Gtk2::Ex::Dragger adds dragging to any widget scrolled through
Gtk2::Adjustment objects.  Basically mouse movement is scaled and
applied to shift the "value" in the adjustments (either horizontally,
vertically, or both).

You can use dragging instead of scrollbars, or as well as them
(probably with Gtk2::ScrolledWindow).  A widget that's not normally
scrollable can be put inside a Gtk2::Viewport to make it so, in the
usual way.

The prerequisites are Gtk2-Perl and Glib-Ex-ObjectBits.
