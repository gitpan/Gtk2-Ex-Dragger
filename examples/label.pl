# This example scrolls a Gtk2::Viewport containing a label.  A Viewport like
# this is the usual way to add scrollability to widgets without their own
# notion of a scrolled position.
#
# Notice the dragger is set on the viewport, not the contained label.  It's
# the viewport which is the visible part corresponding to the adjustment
# page, and responding to the adjustment "value" position.
#
# If you think the scrolling in this example isn't as smooth as in
# textview.pl, well, you're right.  GtkTextView is much more efficient at
# drawing than GtkLabel.  Probably that's fair enough, since a Label is
# normally static, as opposed to TextView designed for editing and moving
# around.  If you want to see how bad the Label gets then try the
# commented-out "update_policy => 'continuous'" in the
# Gtk2::Ex::Dragger->new() call below.  Unless you've got a fast computer
# and fast video card you'll be disappointed by how much the label drawing
# lags the mouse movement.
