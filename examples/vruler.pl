# This bit of nonsense sets up a Gtk2::VRuler to be driven by a
# Gtk2::Adjustment, then a dragger to move the adjustment and hence the
# ruler.
#
# The ruler widgets are a bit freaky, they probably seemed like a good idea
# to someone making a print previewer, but beyond that you're probably not
# going to use them.  As an example though this shows how a widget like a
# ruler that doesn't normally work from an adjustment might be linked up and
# then moved with Gtk2::Ex::Dragger.
#
#
# The triangular "position" marker in the ruler is left to follow the mouse
# of its own accord, in the usual way it does for a ruler.  Whether that's a
# good thing is another matter, but you can't force it -- if you change the
# "position" setting it only fights with the next motion event the ruler
# sees.
