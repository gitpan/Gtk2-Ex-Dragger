# This example shows the interaction between the WidgetCursor "busy"
# mechanism and a Dragger.
#
# Basically the busy cursor is shown, but the Dragger state isn't lost and
# the cursor is restored when unbusy - which is pretty much what you want if
# a scroll provokes some time consuming activity.
#
# As noted in the text below, if you keep wiggling the mouse around the busy
# cursor will continue to show.  That's because it's only removed when idle,
# and the main loop activity you create by wiggling means it's not idle yet.
# This is logical, and you do normally want the busy cursor to stay while
# doing drawing for such wiggling, even if in this case the program is
# interacting and therefore from the user's point of view not really busy.
